    <h1>Personal Summary</h1>
    <p>I’m Israel Olukanni, a computer science student at the University of Virginia with a passion for creative problem-solving through 
        technology and music. I enjoy building web applications, exploring the intersection of tech and community impact, and 
        creating music that reflects my values and background. I’m always eager to collaborate, learn new technologies, and bring 
        ideas to life whether through code, design, or sound.</p>
    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "persum-col">
            <h3>Software Development</h3>
            <p>My software development experience includes building both academic and personal projects using languages like Python, 
                Java, and JavaScript. Through classes like Advanced Software Development and Data Structures, I’ve built web applications
                 using frameworks like Django and React, deployed apps using Heroku, and managed data with PostgreSQL and SQL. 
                 I enjoy solving complex problems and making tools that are intuitive, scalable, and helpful to users. 
                 I’ve also completed technical interview prep with CodePath to refine my algorithmic thinking and collaborative coding skills.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "persum-col">
            <h3>Information Technology</h3>
            <p>As an IT Analyst Intern at Kimley-Horn, I supported over 100 engineers by provisioning PCs and troubleshooting system issues to
                 improve workflow efficiency. I gained experience working in a corporate tech environment, helping bridge communication 
                 between engineers and IT infrastructure. I’m comfortable navigating both hardware and software support issues and enjoy
                  ensuring users can stay focused on their work with minimal tech disruption.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "persum-col">
            <h3>Music Production</h3>
            <p>I have extensive experience in music production through both personal and ministry projects. Using Logic Pro X and Ableton Live,
                 I’ve composed, mixed, and produced songs for my own portfolio as well as for worship events and student ministry organizations. 
                 As a music director for Yahweh Night Ministries, I lead a band and arrange multicultural worship sets.
                  My creative approach to music production balances technical skill with emotional storytelling, and I’m always 
                  exploring new ways to merge sound with message.</p>
